Two  errors that I encountered were:

1. cannot read undefined (on reading split) on line 109 of node_modules/instagram-web-api/lib/index.js
While using _sharedData() in node_modules/instagram-web-api/lib/index.js,
setting _sharedData to false instead of true on line 49 helps to resolve the 'cannot read undefined (on reading split)' error.
Setting _sharedData to false might cause other features like follow and getProfile to fail.

2. StatusCodeError : tatusCodeError: 400 - "{\"debug_info\":{\"retriable\":false,\"type\":\"ProcessingFailedError\",\"message\":\"Request processing failed\"}}"
The error message 400 popped up but went away when I uploaded a jpg image instead of a webp or png.


Info:

1. * * * * * refers to uploading one photo every single day every minute
